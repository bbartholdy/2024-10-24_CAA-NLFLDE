## What is it? {.smaller background-image="images/rchaeostats-screenshot.png" background-size="76%" background-position="50% 100%"}

## Motivation {.center}

Asked to give workshop Deutsches Archäologisches Institut

<br>

Many (not all) of the archaeological teaching materials are focused on specific applications and
University course materials

(nice comprehensive list: [The didactic map of computational archaeology](https://sslarch.github.io/MapofComputationalArchaeology/))

<br>

Something I've wanted to do for a while!


## Motivation {.center background-image="images/arch-languages.png" background-position="90% 50%" background-size="20%"}

<i class="nf nf-seti-r"></i> seems to be popular in Archaeology

## Inspiration

[Good enough practices in scientific computing](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510) 
(Wilson et al. 2017)

- data management
- project organisation
- collaboration (project portability)

[R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) textbook

Data Carpentry - [R for Social Scientists](https://datacarpentry.org/r-socialsci/)


## Teaching philosophy

Not meant to produce programmers and statisticians

<br>

Meant to enable researchers to confidently and reproducibly do their work in R

<br>

Programming concepts sparsely sprinkled throughout (as needed)


## Teaching philosophy {.smaller}

Code along

- can't learn a programming language without doing

"Time to first plot" - [Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel](https://github.com/mine-cetinkaya-rundel)

- early 'wins'
- keep learners motivated

Frequent formative assessments (a.k.a execises)

- helps manage the pace
- feedback on comprehension (workshops)


## Teaching philosophy

tidyverse ecosystem mixed with some base R

::: {.incremental}
- gentlest entry to R (opinion!)
- best-suited for data visualisations and analyses (fact-ish...)
- best illustrations (fact!)

## Teaching philosophy {.smaller}

EDA > statistical tests

Teach statistical concepts, not tests (but also tests...)

::: {.incremental}
- general linear models
- p-values...
  + [statistical significance]{.fragment .strike}
  + [NHST]{.fragment .strike}
  + continuous metric
- confidence intervals
- effect size
- point/parameter estimates
- practical implications (actual significance)
:::

![](https://i.imgflip.com/975264.jpg){.fragment .absolute right="0" top="20"}


## Teaching philosophy

Live coding during workshops

::: {.incremental}
- mirror learners' environment (RStudio with no customisation)
- what, how, why, repeat.
- explain errors (both intentional and unintentional)
:::

. . .

Notes from workshops are hosted on [{{< fa brands github >}} GitHub](https://github.com/bbartholdy/RchaeoStats-workshop-notes) and

. . .

generated during the workshop with [gitautopush](https://github.com/choldgraf/gitautopush)

. . .

Central repo with new branch for each workshop


## Modularity

Make the materials as flexible and customisable as possible:

::: {.incremental}
- duration of course/workshop
- target audience of workshop (beginners, intermediate, advanced)
- field of research (bioarchaeology, neolithic, paleobotany, etc.)
:::

## Materials {.smaller}

`sheep-data.csv`

Sheep astraguli data Mediterranean Iron Age.

> The contribution of Mediterranean connectivity to morphological variability in Iron Age sheep of the Eastern Mediterranean Sierra A. Harding, Angelos Hadjikoumis, Shyama Vermeersch, Roee Shafir, Nimrod Marom. bioRxiv 2022.12.24.521859; https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.12.24.521859

Modifications: removes missing values and variables that can be calculated from existing variables


## Materials {.smaller}

`mortuary-data.xlsx`

Burial data from northeastern Taiwan ranging from the Iron Age through the European colonization period.

> Li-Ying Wang & Ben Marwick, (2021). Compendium of R code and data for "A Bayesian networks approach to infer social changes from burials in northeastern Taiwan during the European colonization period". Online at <https://osf.io/xga6n/>

Accessed from: <https://osf.io/zem9p> (Kiwulan_Burials.xlsx - burials sheet)

Modifications: removes some variables that need cleaning (reduce cleaning complexity)


## Assignments

### Assignment 1: Case Study

Finding, importing, cleaning, and exploring/analysing a dataset.

1.1 Finding, importing, and cleaning

1.2 Exploring

1.3a Modelling (if modelling module is taught)

1.3b Communicating (if communicating module is taught) 


## Assignments

### Assignment 2: Peer feedback

Can someone else reproduce your analysis?

Participants are paired up and need to reproduce each other's work

Each participant produces a [CODECHECK](https://codecheck.org.uk)-style report

- problems encountered
- steps to solve problems

Feedback is incorporated into own project

If Git/GitHub is taught, this will be done via Git
